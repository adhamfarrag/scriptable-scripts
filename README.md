# Scriptable Scripts

This repository contains a collection of script(s) that I use to automate various tasks on my iPhone using [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app/), a very beautiful JavaScript-based automation app for iOS created by [Simon B. St√∏vring](https://twitter.com/simonbs).


To download Scriptable on your iPhone, visit the [App Store Page](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188) or search for "Scriptable".


## First Script:

[Clean URLs](./clean-urls/) : A script that cleans up URLs by removing tracking parameters and other unnecessary parts of the URL, copies the cleaned URL to the clipboard, and displays a Share Sheet with the cleaned URL.
